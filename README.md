# S97 Rules of Engagement (RoE)

    Draft version 2023.04.02
Server 97 rules of engagement (RoE) are as follows.

**All pvp targets are allowed, unless they are:**
 - Any SURVEY ship that is under its protected cargo limit (aka "UPC"). Survey ships have an upside-down triangular icon that resembles a drill. 
 - Any ships in a part of space that requires a token or similar commodity to enter (aka "token space").
 - Any ship participating in an active armada or a ship that is obviously being placed for an armada.

**Exceptions:**
- Any UPC survey ship that is not being used for mining, or moving to/from a system for mining purposes, is a valid target.
- Any UPC survey ship that has been on an empty mining node (aka "z-node") or has been floating in space for at least 60 seconds without moving.
- Any PvP event temporarily suspends RoE, but only for the specific fights that will generate event points (commonly limited to specific systems). 

**Procedures:**
- Any RoE discrepancies should be resolved first by individual discussion (1 on 1), then by alliance discussion (admiral/officer to admiral/officer). Screenshots may be requested of the victim if evidence is required. 

- War (open fighting between specific alliances outside of the RoE) may only be declared by victims of proven RoE-breakers. Wars must be announced in the official server discord and in server galaxy chat prior to being active.

- Being attacked outside of the RoE does not immediately give you the right to retaliate outside of RoE. Please follow the procedures for resolving RoE violations, and remember that new players may not know about RoE.
