S97 Rules of Engagement (RoE)
Draft version 2023.04.02

All pvp targets are allowed except:
-Any SURVEY ship that is under its protected cargo limit (aka "UPC")
-Any ships in a part of space that requires a token or similar resource to enter (aka "token space")
-Any ship participating in an active armada or is obviously being placed for an armada

Exceptions:
-Any survey that is not being used for mining (or moving to/from a system for mining purposes) is a valid target
-Any survey that is on a zeroed node (aka "z-node") or is floating in space for at least 60 seconds without moving
-Any PvP event temporarily suspends RoE, but only for the fights that will generate event points

Any issues or arguments will be resolved first by individual discussion (1 on 1), then by alliance discussion (admiral/officer to admiral/officer).
War (open fighting between specific alliances outside of the RoE) may only be declared by victims of proven RoE-breakers.
Wars must be announced in the server discord and galaxy chat prior to being initiated. 


RoE FAQ

What is RoE:
The Rules of Engagement (RoE) are the self-imposed rules that Star Trek Fleet Command (STFC) players have elected to add to the game.

Why:
Scopely intentionally made PvP too open-ended in STFC, in hopes that players would enter an arms race that would both make the players less efficient in game, and increase player interest in paying to win. 
The rules of engagement are meant to reduce the importance of p2w and limit the extent that players can grief other players, while also making sure everyone has the ability to progress and keep playing the game.

How:
By giving players the ability to mine resources in peace (up to their ship's protected cargo limit), the RoE lets players complete their daily missions and refineries without having to constantly worry about being griefed by other players. 
Anyone breaking the RoE loses the protections of the RoE themselves, and all players will be allowed to grief the rule breaker and ensure the rule-breaker cannot progress until a ceasefire is agreed upon.
